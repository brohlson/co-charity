{"pageContext":{"name":"Girls Who Code","link":"https://girlswhocode.com/","bio":"<p>From the founder, Reshma:</p>\n<p>When I started Girls Who Code, I never would have imagined that we would grow to become a movement reaching almost 90,000 girls of all backgrounds in all 50 states.</p>\n<p>And now, just six years into our work, we’ve reached a tipping point.</p>\n<p>We are on track to achieve gender parity in computer science by 2027. And we know why: because our work is as much about quantity, as it is about quality. We scale our programs to reach more girls in more places, and give them the chance to forge lifelong bonds so they may persist in computer science.</p>\n<p>It’s incredible. But for us, parity is really just the beginning.</p>\n<p>We’ve reached a moment unmatched in our history, a moment as full of anger and anguish as it is promise and potential. Women and girls across the country are coming together to correct centuries-long power imbalances across lines of gender, race, sexuality, and more.</p>\n<p>Girls Who Code is proud to be a part of this movement, and even prouder because our girls – girls of all races and ethnicities and abilities and zip codes – are leading it.</p><p>They are solving problems in their communities, empowering their friends, and defining the future of our world..</p>\n<p>We’re thrilled to be giving them the tools they need to get there.</p>\n<p>I hope you’ll join us and make sure every girl has the chance to change her world – our world – for the better. Thank you for your support..</p>","image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/AeBCi022QQjyZ3329tCI_girls-who-code-min.jpg"}]}}
